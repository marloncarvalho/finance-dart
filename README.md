# Finance in Dart
It's a simple application built using Angular 2 for Dart. I've started building it with only one goal in mind: to learn Dart and Angular 2.
The first version was built using Angular's Developer Preview version but I'm always updating its source code to reflect new Angular 2 features
or Dart recent improvements.

This project is not intended to be a production ready Finance application, even though I'm using it to control my own finances. :) Think of it as a educational project.
If you're learning Angular 2 and Dart too, feel free to send your suggestions and ideas.
